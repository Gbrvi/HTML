                <h2>Peace Sells by Megadeth</h2>
                What do you mean: I don't believe in God?  <br>
                I talk to him everyday <br>
                What do you mean: I don't support your system? <br>
                I go to court when I have to <br>
                What do you mean: I can't get to work on time? <br>
                I got nothing better to do <br>
                And, what do you mean: I don't pay my bills? <br>
                Why do you think I'm broke? Huh? 
            </p>

            <p>
                If there's a new way <br>
                I'll be the first in line <br>
                But it better work this time
            </p>

            <p>
                What do you mean: I hurt your feelings? <br>
                I didn't know you had any feelings <br>
                What do you mean: I ain't kind? <br>
                Just not your kind <br>
                What do you mean: I couldn't be the President <br> of the United States of America? <br>
                Tell me something, it's still: We the people, right?
            </p>

            <p>
                If there's a new way <br>
                I'll be the first in line <br>
                But it better work this time <br>
                Can you put a price on peace?
            </p>
